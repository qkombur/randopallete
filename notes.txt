Notes:

Trying to make website where 3 random colors (within reason) are picked and then
previews how the website would look. 

Will need javascript.


3 Blocks or palette

color = randomColor

randomColor (
	rgbvalue();
)

Some objects won't be changed. Content is placed on a pleasing white platform following material design principles. (quick material design?)

This script  pulls every accent color. Needs to be reworked to pull all of them.

[].filter.call(document.querySelectorAll('.color-group .color'), function(el) {
		return el.querySelector('.shade').textContent === 'A400';
	}).map(function (el) {
		return el.querySelector('.hex').textContent;
	});

Lot's of issues trying to get the body background and body background to be seperate colors. Figured that shit out though

Trying to extend div to the bottom of the page.

p. button needs to restart script and clear divs
s. button refreshs page. not sure if optimal.

added button styling and overhaul of background colors.

added rgb to hex conversion using http://stackoverflow.com/questions/5623838/rgb-to-hex-and-hex-to-rgb

after much wrangling hexcode is now underneath my fuckin colors.

Finished project into beta stage with nice open sans 100 weight.

Features yet to be impleted are actual matieral design swatches,
and  styling switches based on swatches.
